# Maze Game

This is a Maze Game that I created as part of my final synoptic project for my Software Developer apprenticeship.

# Project Overview and Objectives 
You work for Olde Worlde Phunne, a computer gaming company. They want to increase the 
number of visitors to their website by offering a free maze game, which potential customers 
can get access to by signing up to their website. Your manager would like you to design, 
build, and test an initial version of this component – the “Maze Game”. This initial version 
may either itself be a website or a stand-alone program to be downloaded from the website.

An apprentice will need to:

    1. Review all the key information and create a design for the maze game;
    2. Construct the maze game in accordance with the design;
    3. Test that the maze game meets its requirements;
    4. Document what you built.
